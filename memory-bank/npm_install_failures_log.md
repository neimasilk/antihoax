# NPM Install Failure Log for AntiHoax Frontend (Dev1)

This document logs the persistent failures encountered during the `npm install` and `npx` command executions while attempting to set up the frontend project for "AntiHoax Cerdas AI" as per `baby-step-dev1.md`.

## Date: 2025-06-03 17:58:21

## Issue: `Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, uv_cwd`

This error occurred consistently during the following attempts:

1.  **Attempting `npx create-react-app antihoax-frontend`:**
    *   The command would report successful execution.
    *   However, the created `antihoax-frontend/src` directory was incomplete. Essential files like `index.css`, `App.css` were missing.
    *   `git status` did not recognize new files created by `create-react-app`.
    *   This prevented subsequent steps like configuring Tailwind CSS.

2.  **Attempting manual project setup with `npm install`:**
    *   After manually creating `package.json` and the directory structure for `antihoax-frontend`.
    *   Running `npm install` inside `antihoax-frontend` failed directly with the `Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, uv_cwd`.
    *   This error indicates that Node.js/npm lost access to its current working directory during execution.

## Impact:

This error is critical and blocks all frontend development progress because:

*   Project dependencies cannot be installed.
*   React application cannot be built, started, or tested.
*   Tools like Tailwind CSS cannot be initialized or used.

The tasks outlined in `baby-step-dev1.md` cannot be completed until this underlying environment issue with `npm install` (and `npx` by extension) is resolved.
