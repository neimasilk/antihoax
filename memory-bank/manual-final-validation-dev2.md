# Manual Final Validation Checklist Guide (Dev2 - Backend)

This document outlines the steps and checks required to manually validate the complete backend implementation as per `memory-bank/baby-step-dev2.md`. This guide assumes you have an environment where you can successfully run `npm install` and execute the Node.js application.

**Prerequisites:**
*   All source code, documentation, and configuration files from all four phases of `baby-step-dev2.md` are present in the `antihoax-backend` directory.
*   You have successfully run `npm install` (and any other necessary package installations like `npm install axios express-rate-limit supertest rotating-file-stream --save-dev/--save`) in the `antihoax-backend` directory.
*   All placeholders in the code (e.g., for `require` statements of uninstalled packages) have been corrected.
*   A valid `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is configured in your `.env` file.
*   The application can be started using `npm run dev`.

## I. Execute Phase-Specific Manual Testing Guides

Before proceeding with the final checklist, ensure you have gone through and successfully completed all tests described in the following manual testing guides:

1.  **`memory-bank/manual-test-phase1-dev2.md`**: Covers basic project setup, server health, and initial API structure.
2.  **`memory-bank/manual-test-phase2-dev2.md`**: Covers DeepSeek API integration, verification service, and status endpoint.
3.  **`memory-bank/manual-test-phase3-dev2.md`**: Covers comprehensive API tests (automated and manual script), rate limiting, and other refinements.

Successful completion of these guides is essential.

## II. Final Validation Checklist (from baby-step-dev2.md)

This checklist is taken directly from the "Final Validation Checklist" section of `memory-bank/baby-step-dev2.md`. Please verify each item in your runnable environment:

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Server starts without errors (`npm run dev`).
- [ ] All API endpoints work correctly (as tested via manual guides and `tests/api.test.js`).
- [ ] DeepSeek integration functions properly (live calls return expected data structures).
- [ ] Validation middleware works as expected (e.g., for text length, required fields).
- [ ] Error handling provides appropriate responses (e.g., 400, 404, 429, 500 errors are handled gracefully).
- [ ] Logging provides useful debugging information (check console for Morgan logs and potentially custom logs if `requestLogger.js` was integrated).

### Performance & Security
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented and working (as tested in Phase 3 guide).
- [ ] Request caching improves performance (if `cache.js` was integrated and tested as per Phase 3 guide).
- [ ] Security headers are properly set (Helmet is included in `app.js`).
- [ ] Input validation prevents malicious input (covered by middleware).
- [ ] No sensitive data is logged or exposed (review logs and API responses).

### Testing
- [ ] All automated tests pass (`npm test` - requires `supertest` and a working environment).
- [ ] Manual testing script works correctly (`npm run test:manual` - requires `axios`).
- [ ] API handles edge cases properly (consider empty inputs, very long inputs if not covered by validation, different `type` values for `/api/verify`).
- [ ] Error scenarios are tested (e.g., invalid DeepSeek API key, network issues if possible to simulate).
- [ ] Performance is acceptable (< 30 seconds for analysis - observe response times, especially for DeepSeek calls).

### Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] API documentation is complete (`docs/API.md` accurately reflects the API).
- [ ] Setup instructions work for new developers (`README.md` is clear and accurate).
- [ ] Docker configuration is functional (`Dockerfile` can build, `docker-compose up` works - requires Docker environment).
- [ ] Environment variables are documented (`.env.example`, `README.md`).
- [ ] Deployment process is defined (`scripts/deploy.sh` is present, though it's a template).

### Integration Readiness
- [ ] CORS is configured for frontend (allows requests from `FRONTEND_URL` in `.env`).
- [ ] API contract matches frontend expectations (matches `baby-step-dev1.md` if available, or general REST principles).
- [ ] Response format is consistent (JSON, success flags, data/error objects).
- [ ] Error responses are helpful for frontend (clear messages, status codes).
- [ ] Status endpoint (`/api/verify/status`) provides useful information.

---

If all items on this checklist can be marked as complete in your runnable environment, then the backend implementation as per `baby-step-dev2.md` can be considered fully validated.
