# Baby-Step Development Guide: Frontend Developer (Dev1)

**Role:** Frontend Developer - UI/UX and React Components
**Timeline:** Week 1-2 (Parallel with Backend and Data teams)
**Prerequisites:** Basic knowledge of React.js, Tailwind CSS, and modern JavaScript

## CRITICAL RULE: DO NOT PROCEED TO NEXT STEP UNTIL ALL TESTS PASS

Each step must be completed and tested thoroughly before moving to the next step. This ensures code quality and prevents cascading issues.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Environment (Day 1)

### Step 1.1: Initialize React Project with Tailwind CSS

**Objective:** Set up a clean React project with Tailwind CSS for styling

**Tasks:**
1. Create new React project using Create React App:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app antihoax-frontend
   cd antihoax-frontend
   ```
   *(Attempted, but `npx create-react-app` did not yield a complete/usable skeleton due to environment issues)*

2. Install and configure Tailwind CSS:
   ```bash
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   ```
   *(Attempted, `npm install` failed, `npx tailwindcss init -p` failed)*

3. Configure `tailwind.config.js`:
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     content: [
       "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
     ],
     theme: {
       extend: {
         colors: {
           'hoax-red': '#ef4444',
           'fact-green': '#22c55e',
           'neutral-yellow': '#eab308',
         }
       },
     },
     plugins: [],
   }
   ```
   *(File created manually as part of aborted Phase 1 attempt in `antihoax-frontend`)*

4. Update `src/index.css` with Tailwind directives:
   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```
   *(File created manually as part of aborted Phase 1 attempt in `antihoax-frontend`)*

**Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] React app starts successfully with `npm start` *(Blocked by `npm install` failure)*
- [ ] Tailwind CSS classes work (test with a simple colored div) *(Blocked by `npm install` failure)*
- [ ] No console errors in browser *(Blocked by `npm install` failure)*
- [ ] Custom colors (hoax-red, fact-green, neutral-yellow) are accessible *(Blocked by `npm install` failure)*

**Testing:**
```javascript
// Add this to App.js temporarily to test Tailwind
<div className="bg-hoax-red text-white p-4">Hoax Red Test</div>
<div className="bg-fact-green text-white p-4">Fact Green Test</div>
<div className="bg-neutral-yellow text-white p-4">Neutral Yellow Test</div>
```
*(Testing blocked)*

### Step 1.2: Create Project Structure

**Objective:** Establish a clean and scalable folder structure

**Tasks:**
1. Create folder structure in `src/`:
   ```
   src/
   ├── components/
   │   ├── common/
   │   ├── forms/
   │   └── results/
   ├── pages/
   ├── hooks/
   ├── utils/
   ├── services/
   └── constants/
   ```
   `[x]` *(Directory structure created)*

2. Create index files for each component folder:
   ```javascript
   // src/components/common/index.js
   // src/components/forms/index.js
   // src/components/results/index.js
   ```
   `[x]` *(Placeholder index files created)*

**Validation Criteria:**
- [x] All folders are created correctly
- [x] Index files exist and can be imported without errors *(Files exist, import not tested)*
- [ ] Project structure follows React best practices *(Structure created, but overall project not testable)*

## Phase 2: Core UI Components (Day 2-3)

### Step 2.1: Create Input Component
*(Note: The component content in the original baby-step for NewsInput.jsx was different from the one implemented in subtask dev1-phase2-step2.1. The implementation from the subtask instructions was used.)*

**Objective:** Build a reusable text input component for news verification

**Tasks:**
1. Create `src/components/forms/NewsInput.jsx`:
   `[x]` *(File created with content from subtask instructions)*
   ```javascript
   // Content from subtask dev1-phase2-step2.1 was used
   import React from 'react';
   import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

   const NewsInput = ({ value, onChange, placeholder = "Masukkan teks berita di sini...", disabled = false }) => {
     // ... (implementation from subtask)
   };
   // ...
   export default NewsInput;
   ```

2. Create `src/components/forms/index.js`:
   `[x]` *(File created/updated)*
   ```javascript
   export { default as NewsInput } from './NewsInput';
   ```

**Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] Component renders without errors *(Not tested in running app)*
- [ ] Radio buttons switch between text and URL modes *(Original component had this, implemented one does not)*
- [ ] Placeholder text changes based on input type *(N/A for implemented version)*
- [ ] Submit button is disabled when input is empty *(N/A for implemented version, uses props)*
- [ ] Loading state disables input and shows loading text *(Implemented via `disabled` prop)*
- [ ] onSubmit callback receives correct data format *(N/A for implemented version, uses `onChange`)*

**Testing:**
*(Testing blocked, component structure differs from original test plan)*

### Step 2.2: Create Result Display Component
*(Note: The component content in the original baby-step for VerificationResult.jsx was different. The implementation from subtask dev1-phase2-step2.2 was used.)*

**Objective:** Build a component to display verification results clearly

**Tasks:**
1. Create `src/components/results/VerificationResult.jsx`:
   `[x]` *(File created with content from subtask instructions)*
   ```javascript
   // Content from subtask dev1-phase2-step2.2 was used
   import React from 'react';
   import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
   
   const VerificationResult = ({ result, isLoading }) => {
     // ... (implementation from subtask)
   };
   // ...
   export default VerificationResult;
   ```

2. Update `src/components/results/index.js`:
   `[x]` *(File created/updated)*
   ```javascript
   export { default as VerificationResult } from './VerificationResult';
   ```

**Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] Component renders different styles for each status (hoaks, fakta, meragukan) *(Not tested in running app, but logic is present)*
- [ ] Confidence score displays correctly with progress bar *(Implemented version does not have confidence bar)*
- [ ] Explanation text renders properly *(Not tested in running app)*
- [ ] Red flags list displays when available *(Implemented version does not have red flags)*
- [ ] Sources links are clickable and open in new tab *(Implemented version does not have sources)*
- [ ] Component handles missing data gracefully *(Not tested in running app, but logic is present for null/loading)*

**Testing:**
*(Testing blocked, component structure differs from original test plan)*

### Step 2.3: Create Loading Component
*(Note: The component content in the original baby-step for LoadingSpinner.jsx was different. The implementation from subtask dev1-phase2-step2.3 was used.)*

**Objective:** Build a loading indicator for better user experience

**Tasks:**
1. Create `src/components/common/LoadingSpinner.jsx`:
   `[x]` *(File created with content from subtask instructions)*
   ```javascript
   // Content from subtask dev1-phase2-step2.3 was used
   import React from 'react';
   import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

   const LoadingSpinner = ({ size = 'md', text = null, color = 'text-blue-600' }) => {
    // ... (implementation from subtask)
   };
   // ...
   export default LoadingSpinner;
   ```

2. Update `src/components/common/index.js`:
   `[x]` *(File created/updated)*
   ```javascript
   export { default as LoadingSpinner } from './LoadingSpinner';
   ```

**Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] Spinner animates smoothly *(Not tested in running app)*
- [ ] Different sizes work correctly *(Not tested in running app, but logic for size prop is present)*
- [ ] Message displays properly *(Not tested in running app, but logic for text prop is present)*
- [ ] Component is reusable across the app *(Designed for reusability)*

## Phase 3: Main Page Layout (Day 4)

### Step 3.1: Create Main Application Layout
*(Note: The component content in the original baby-step for HomePage.jsx was different. The implementation from subtask dev1-phase3-step3.1 was used.)*

**Objective:** Integrate all components into a cohesive main page

**Tasks:**
1. Create `src/pages/HomePage.jsx`:
   `[x]` *(File created with content from subtask instructions)*
   ```javascript
   // Content from subtask dev1-phase3-step3.1 was used
   import React, { useState } from 'react';
   // ... imports
   const HomePage = () => {
     // ... (implementation from subtask with simulated API call)
   };
   export default HomePage;
   ```

2. Update `src/App.js`:
   `[x]` *(File created/updated)*
   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';
   import HomePage from './pages/HomePage';
   import './App.css'; // App.css created as empty file
   
   function App() {
     return (
       <div className="App">
         <HomePage />
       </div>
     );
   }
   
   export default App;
   ```

**Validation Criteria:**

- [ ] Input form works and triggers loading state *(Not tested in running app)*
- [ ] Loading spinner shows during mock API call *(Not tested in running app)*
- [ ] Mock result displays correctly after loading *(Not tested in running ઉapp)*
- [ ] Error handling works (test by modifying code to throw error) *(Not tested in running app)*
- [ ] Footer displays at bottom of page *(Not tested in running app)*

## Phase 4: API Integration Preparation (Day 5)

### Step 4.1: Create API Service Layer
*(Note: The component content in the original baby-step was different. The implementation from subtask dev1-phase4-step4.1 was used.)*

**Objective:** Prepare service layer for backend integration

**Tasks:**
1. Create `src/services/api.js`:
   `[x]` *(File created with content from subtask instructions)*
   ```javascript
   // Content from subtask dev1-phase4-step4.1 (simulated API)
   export const verifyNewsText = async (newsText) => {
     // ... (implementation from subtask)
   };
   ```

2. Create `src/hooks/useVerification.js`:
   `[x]` *(File created with content from subtask instructions)*
   ```javascript
   // Content from subtask dev1-phase4-step4.1
   import { useState } from 'react';
   import { verifyNewsText } from '../services/api';
   
   const useVerification = () => {
     // ... (implementation from subtask)
   };
   export default useVerification;
   ```

3. Update `src/pages/HomePage.jsx` to use the new hook:
   `[x]` *(File updated as per subtask instructions)*
   ```javascript
   // Relevant part from subtask dev1-phase4-step4.1
   import useVerification from '../hooks/useVerification';
   // ...
   const { isLoading, error, verificationResult, verifyNews } = useVerification();
   // ...
   // onClick={handleVerifyClick} where handleVerifyClick calls verifyNews(newsText)
   ```

**Validation Criteria:**
- [x] API service can be imported without errors *(File exists, import not tested at runtime)*
- [ ] useVerification hook works with mock data *(Not tested in running app)*
- [ ] Error handling works for network failures *(Not tested in running app, but hook has try-catch)*
- [ ] Environment variable for API URL is configurable *(.env files created, but usage not tested)*
- [x] Code is ready for backend integration *(Code structure is present)*

### Step 4.2: Add Environment Configuration

**Objective:** Set up environment variables for different deployment stages

**Tasks:**
1. Create `.env.development`:
   `[x]` *(File created)*
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
   REACT_APP_ENV=development
   ```

2. Create `.env.production`:
   `[x]` *(File created)*
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
   REACT_APP_ENV=production
   ```

3. Update `.gitignore` to include:
   `[x]` *(File created/updated)*
   ```
   # Environment variables
   .env.local
   .env.development.local
   .env.test.local
   .env.production.local
   ```

**Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] Environment variables load correctly *(Not tested in running app)*
- [ ] API URL changes based on environment *(Not tested in running app)*
- [x] Sensitive data is not committed to git *(.env files are in .gitignore, but .env.development and .env.production are committed as per instructions - this is fine as they don't hold real secrets yet)*

## Phase 5: Testing and Documentation (Day 6)

### Step 5.1: Component Testing
*(Note: Actual component testing in a running app is blocked)*
**Objective:** Ensure all components work correctly

**Tasks:**
1. Test each component individually:
   - [ ] NewsInput with different input types
   - [ ] VerificationResult with different status types
   - [ ] LoadingSpinner with different sizes
   - [ ] HomePage with different states

2. Create `src/utils/testData.js` for consistent test data:
   `[x]` *(File created with content from subtask instructions)*
   ```javascript
   // Content from subtask dev1-phase5
   export const sampleHoaxText = \`...\`;
   // ...
   ```

**Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] All components render without errors *(Not tested)*
- [ ] User interactions work as expected *(Not tested)*
- [ ] Different data scenarios display correctly *(Not tested)*
- [ ] Responsive design works on different screen sizes *(Not tested)*

### Step 5.2: Create Documentation

**Objective:** Document the frontend implementation for team collaboration

**Tasks:**
1. Create `frontend/README.md` (actually `antihoax-frontend/README.md`):
   `[x]` *(File created)*
   ```markdown
   # AntiHoax Cerdas AI - Frontend
   // ... (content from subtask)
   ```

2. Update component files with JSDoc comments:
   `[x]` *(JSDoc added to NewsInput.jsx, VerificationResult.jsx, LoadingSpinner.jsx)*
   ```javascript
   /**
    * NewsInput Component
    // ... (JSDoc added)
   */
   // ...
   ```

**Validation Criteria:**
- [x] README.md is comprehensive and accurate
- [x] Components are documented with JSDoc
- [ ] Setup instructions work for new developers *(Blocked by npm install issues)*
- [x] API integration points are clearly documented *(In README and code)*
