# Status, To-Do List, and Suggestions for Dev1 (Frontend)

## Date: 2025-06-03 18:27:39

## Status of Dev1 Work (`baby-step-dev1.md`)

All planned file creation and code writing tasks outlined in `baby-step-dev1.md` for the frontend developer (Dev1) have been **attempted**. This includes:

*   **Phase 1: Project Setup and Environment**
    *   Step 1.1 (Initialize React Project & Tailwind): Attempted, but **BLOCKED** by `npm install` failures. Project dependencies are not installed.
    *   Step 1.2 (Create Project Structure): Directory structure created.
*   **Phase 2: Core UI Components**
    *   `NewsInput.jsx`, `VerificationResult.jsx`, `LoadingSpinner.jsx` files created with specified code.
*   **Phase 3: Main Page Layout**
    *   `HomePage.jsx` created and `App.js` updated.
*   **Phase 4: API Integration Preparation**
    *   `api.js` (service layer), `useVerification.js` (hook) created.
    *   `.env` files and `.gitignore` updates completed.
*   **Phase 5: Testing and Documentation**
    *   `testData.js` and `README.md` created.
    *   JSDoc comments added to components.

**CRITICAL ISSUE:** The frontend project (`antihoax-frontend`) is currently **NON-FUNCTIONAL**. A persistent error (`Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, uv_cwd`) occurs during `npm install`. This prevents installation of any dependencies, building the application, running tests, or any form of validation. This issue has been documented in `memory-bank/npm_install_failures_log.md`.

The `baby-step-dev1.md` file in the `memory-bank` has been updated with checkboxes reflecting the (mostly untested and unvalidated) status of each item.

## To-Do List & Suggestions for Dev1

1.  **BLOCKER RESOLUTION (Highest Priority):**
    *   **Investigate and resolve the `npm install` / `uv_cwd` error within the development environment.** This is essential before any further frontend development or testing can proceed.
    *   **Suggestion:** This may require external intervention or changes to the underlying execution environment configuration for Node.js/npm.

2.  **Once Blocker is Resolved - Complete `baby-step-dev1.md` Validations:**
    *   Successfully run `npm install` (or equivalent like `yarn install`).
    *   Perform all validation and testing steps for each phase of `baby-step-dev1.md`:
        *   Phase 1: Start app, test Tailwind.
        *   Phase 2: Render and test each component (`NewsInput`, `VerificationResult`, `LoadingSpinner`).
        *   Phase 3: Test `HomePage` layout, mock API calls, error display.
        *   Phase 4: Test API service layer with mock data, ensure environment variables load.
        *   Phase 5: Run component tests (if actual test scripts were to be written beyond manual validation).
    *   Update all checkboxes in `baby-step-dev1.md` to `[x]` upon successful validation.
    *   Ensure the "Final Validation Checklist" in `baby-step-dev1.md` is fully passed.

3.  **API Contract Validation & Integration (Post-Blocker & Validation):**
    *   Coordinate with Backend Developer (Dev2) to confirm the API request/response format for `/api/verify` and `/api/health`.
    *   Update `REACT_APP_API_URL` in `.env.development` once the backend is available.
    *   Replace mock API calls in `HomePage.jsx` (or `useVerification.js`) with actual calls to the live backend.
    *   Perform integration testing.

4.  **Error Handling Refinement (Post-Integration):**
    *   Refine frontend error messages based on actual API responses from the backend.

5.  **Address Pending Items from Original `status-todolist-saran.md` (if applicable after blocker):**
    *   Review the original `status-todolist-saran.md` for any Dev1 tasks that become relevant after the current `baby-step-dev1.md` is truly complete.

## Notes for Team:

*   The primary focus for Dev1 MUST be the resolution of the `npm install` environmental issue.
*   No further progress on features or integration is meaningful until the frontend project can be built and run.
